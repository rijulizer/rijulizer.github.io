            Under the same project, it was another feature. Some stores that closed due to covid restrictions in 2020
            reopened and their sales pattern got changed. The trained model was not able to predict this change.
            What made the task challenging, was the fact that, due to some business-level decisions retraining or
            introducing a new model for these stores was restricted.

            domain to
            another image in another domain, CycleGAN doesn't require a dataset of paired images. For Horase to Zebra

          I am a Data Scientist with 3+ years of work experience. I got introduced to Machine Learning 
          while pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Electronics. I found the subject very enthralling and 
          switched my Area of Interest and started my career as an Intern in a Data Science project. 
          Since then, I have worked on more than three major projects and in many pet projects. Also, 
          I have tried my hand in teaching the subject part-time. By doing research-oriented application-based 
          ML projects I got inclined to research and have co-authored a research paper. My goal is to advance 
          AI for all humanity.

          <p class="resume-list__block-date"><i>in International Symposium on Advanced Electrical and Communication Technologies(ISAECT 20)</i> <br>DOI : <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ISAECT50560.2020.9523706"> 10.1109/ISAECT50560.2020.9523706</a></p>
          <p>
            The paper is about the detection of surface water using 14 band satellite imagery. We used two different Neural-Network architectures
            and compared them. Proposed an indirect proxy-based data collection method that eliminates the overload
            of manual data collection of surface water from ground-based surveys. Also, did a comparative study to
            check the sensitivity of model accuracy on data size, which clarifies the required size of training
            data-points. This work has its application in the field of Location Intelligence.

            In TCS, I was part of a sales demand forecasting team called Next Generation Replenishment(NGR).
            Particularly, our objective was to develop a system that can predict store transactions with zero
            manual interventions. We used many machine learning and statistical tools to achieve a high accuracy.
            We migrated the code base into Pyspark in Azure DataBricks. I handled two subprojects, 'New Stores Solution'
            and 'Big Gap Stores'. To know more about them please check out <a href="#projects">My_Projects</a>

                    his job -- such as building data science solutions and reporting to stakeholders -- but also learn other 
                    tasks that extend well beyond the scope of his role. Riju works well with the client to answer complex

          <p class="portfolio-modal__description">
            We are building a graph based omnichannel product recommendation system. According to the problem definition, 
            the system is supposed to recommend funds (products) to advisors (users).<br> First, using different types of data, 
            we are constructing a Heterogeneous graph. That means, each node and edge types have different sets of features. 
            Each edge type represents a particular relationship. For example, web activity, like website clicks is one such 
            edge type between users and products. Node features and edge features are manually selected to provide good 
            predictive and generalization power to the model.<br> Once the graph is ready, we are applying graph neural network 
            based models to learn the latent node embeddings. Here is the catch, recommendation is subjective problem to provide 
            the model an objective function, we are translating the problem as a ‘link-prediction’ task . Basically, given the graph, 
            we are asking the trained model to predict whether there should be a link/edge between two nodes (an advsior and a product). 
            In essence, it becomes a binary classification with two labels- 0 and 1, where 1 means high probability of an edge. 
            <br> Once the model is trained, we extract the node embeddings and applied post-processing to get a ranked recommendation. 
            Now, in order to train the model, we need data of both the class labels (0,1). However, graph has no edge that represents 
            label 0 (absence of an edge). So, we need to augment edges with label 0 between nodes that do not have an edge in reality. 
            I found the package DeepSanp by stanford particularly useful for this task. I added one more feature to it, after which, the GNN 
            model (GraphSage) considers features of edges too. To evaluate the accuracy of the final recommendation, I have 
            introduced a new metric called Average Intersection (AI), it is a modified verison of Mean Average Precision (MAP), 
            a very popular metric to evaluate recommendations. The AI is being used on the test data. I am getting superior results, 
            our model is beating the existing baseline. My solution is going to production!!

            Predicting store-customer transactions for the new stores is very difficult. since, they have newly opened, they 
            do not have enough history with which we can train an ML model. In that case, the obvious alternative is to find 
            a similar store based on store properties and assume that the behaviors would be similar. For example, a 1000 sq. 
            feet retail store in Amsterdam may behave like another existing 1050 sq. ft. store in another part of Amsterdam. 
            <br>However, this approach is intuition-driven and not data-driven and it did not yield good results. My approach was, 
            we have to find a similar, reference store for the new store, based on limited transactions data that is available of the new stores. 
            We set the cutoff as 14 days, once a store has more than 14 days of data, using this data we are creating some 
            features. Similarly, we have created features for old stores. Due to IP issues, I can not discuss the features or 
            how they have been created but, the features did capture the normalized transaction pattern. <br>We used a clustering 
            algorithm on these features as a result of which we got clusters of stores containing both new and old. In a 
            particular cluster, all the old stores are contestants of reference stores for a particular new store. This step 
            narrows down our search space, after this, we check the correlation between a new store and each contestant. The old 
            store with the highest correlation is determined as the reference store. 
            <br>Congratulations! Now, once a reference store is fixed, 
            we did some processing to level their average transaction amount (it is possible that the reference store’s average 
            is 10000 but the new store’s only 100). We extracted weekly uplift coefficients for 7 days of the week. We applied 
            these coeffs to the history of the reference store and augmented this modified history to the new store. From this point, 
            the existing trained ML models can pick up and start predicting. As new data pores in, it is highly possible that the 
            new stores behave aberrantly than their respective reference stores. That is why we have set the code such a way that if the accuracy 
            goes down, it will automatically search for a new reference store using the same algorithm. 
            <br>My approach did give superior results to the existing system and it got integrated with the main system. 
            You may ask what happens for the first 14 days? Well, the shop owner is probably inviting her friends and family 
            and taking selfies, she does not care that much about predictions generated by a machine!!

            The retail chain company, for which we were providing the forecasting solutions had many stores of 
            different types across different European countries. One such store type is called the ‘to-go’ stores. 
            There are usually small stores typically connected with a rail station or a bus stop. These are the stores 
            that were closed due to covid and their transactions fall to zero. Once they reopened their transaction pattern 
            got changed completely and the previously trained models could not predict this changed pattern. The task was 
            particularly challenging as we were not supposed to use any new model due to business-level decisions and we 
            had to come up with a solution really fast.
            <br>We observed that the model is able to predict the seasonal aspect of the transactions pattern but it is not 
            able to predict the trend aspect. The Long-Gap stores were showing a visible trend, each week as situations got 
            normalized, the stores were having higher transactions. Since our trained models had a feature to capture the 
            short-term changes we needed to augment data for the last 4 weeks. We extrapolated the trend backward and 
            manufactured data for the model to capture. Our code was able to generate this augmented data every week, as the 
            trend changes drastically the augmented data changes accordingly. This solution was working fine and giving amazing 
            results. However, it took us some time in the testing, and before we could productionize, most of the log-gap 
            stores were already long-opened. Also, our code was able to pick such stores that may need special attention 
            and can be classified as long-gap, automatically, without any manual interruption. The solution is in production 
            now, in future, if a similar situation may arise, we believe it will be handled well.

            CycleGANs are a significant step forward in the domain of style transfer. Previous style transfer models, 
            such as pix2pix, required a paired set of training images in both source and target domain. The idea is 
            like how to convert English to French without having knowledge of each sentence in both the languages. 
            If we translate from English to French and from french to English back again, the original English sentence 
            and the double translated English sentence with be similar if both the translators are correct.
            <br>A CycleGAN is composed of 4 Deep NN models, 2 generators and 2 discriminators. If there are two domains 
            A,B for my example, horse pictures (A) and zebra pictures (B), then generator G_ab learns to convert images 
            from domain A to B, generator G_ba learns to convert images from domain B to A. Discriminator D_a learns to 
            discriminate real images of domain A and fake images generated by G_ba and discriminator D_b learns to 
            discriminate real images of domain b and fake images generated by G_ba. 
            <br>For horse to zebra translation, the required data set is availble online. I tested with different depth 
            and network architectures for the 2 types of deep neural net models. As the proble was really complex, my 
            training was not converging, a very common problem for GANs so the trick that I used is- after every 3 epochs, 
            I loaded the latest weights for the generator, and for the discriminator, loaded the weights that were 
            saved 3 epochs back. The results are somewhat funny and the fact that it worked was kind of magical.

            Static-Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a special type of Random Access Memory (RAM) which as the name suggests is static, 
            that means, it does not need to be refreshed in order to keep the memory. As our final year under grad project, we 
            designed a 32Kb SRAM memory array. It was designed to be used in a bigger chip Venus 2, designed under India Chip 
            Program,to monitor the water quality of river Yamuna. Electronics Centre of Excellence (e-COE) shared their resources 
            with us, our chip should solve the purpose of the memory in thor test chip “Mercury-2”. It is 32K SRAM memory unit with 
            1K entries of 32 bits, designed using gpdk045nm technology and tsmc065nm for convergence. It has an address size of 10 
            bits, i/o size of 32 bits, the Bit-Cell circuit is industry standard 6-T SRAM cell with 2-track poly design.
            We have designed the several aspects of the complete memory cell including the schematic level and the layout level 
            design. In the floor plan we had- memory cell, decoder, local control, local-i/o, global control and global-i/o.
            <br>We have extracted the Verilog netlist from the schematic using Cadence Virtuoso and successfully completed the 
            functional verification of different parts like- Bit-Celll, Input D-Latch, Sense-Amplifier etc. 
            <br>For timing simulations, we followed the critical path testing mechanism. The reason is that, the entire 32Kb 
            memory can not be simulated altogateher due to the compute limitations. Instead we tested the four corners(tt,ff,fs,ss) 
            and the necessary circuit was included in the critical path model in order to achieve this. We have also 
            completed the Timing Simulations and the Power Simulations. Our aim was to design the memory so that it may 
            operate at a speed of 1GHz. The design and simulations were successful. After fabrication if the chip works 
            well then we can repeat this module to create a memory large enough for practical purposes.
